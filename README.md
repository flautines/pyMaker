# pyMaker
A Game framework which aims to simplify game development with PyGame

The goal of this project is to create a framework in PyGame which is close to (but not an exact nmatch) to how GameMaker is used to create games. Thus there are GameObjects, GameRoom and SndObject objects and behaviour code is meant to be typed into the 'onCreate()', 'Step()', 'Collision()' methods.

The aim is not to replicate the GameMaker script language (GML) to python.
